            The Nook is a wine bar, where you can find drinks of all varieties
            and seasonal food! Our focus is to serve only what we love, with the
            friendliest service and handpicked great music as a bonus!

                <p>
                  Fresh homemade food alongside all the wine bar classics. We
                  have great suppliers for our cheese, charcuterie, olives and
                  snacks. We pickle and ferment, as well as banging out
                  delicious chutneys, sauces and spreads.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is possible to shop deli products, bottles of natural wine,
                  beers and fresh bread from Bread by Bike for takeaway. We are
                  working on our takeaway offer to be available for deliveries
                  in London and nationwide too. Just keep an eye on our updates!
                  On Friday and Saturdays we also cook some eggs and cheeky
                  sandwiches for lunchtime alongside shaking some cocktails just
                  because we think a strong brunch is the best way to start a
                  cheeky weekend or get over a hangover!
