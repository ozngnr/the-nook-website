          <p>
            The Nook is an all day venue, where you can find drinks and food for
            all times of the day alongside friendly company and lively music.
            You can come and hangout with us in the deli or pop in for a shop!

                <h3>DELI</h3>
                <p>
                  Fresh homemade food for all times of the day to have it in or
                  take away. We have breakfast specials and pastries in the
                  morning, indulgent hot sandwiches plus daily mezze and salads
                  for lunch and a dinner menu for dining with us in the
                  evenings.
                </p>

                  We called it Contemporary European with a Turkish Twist which
                  in short, is a lot of fresh seasonal food that goes well with
                  wine. On Saturdays and Sundays we also cook all sorts of eggs
                  and shake some cocktails. We think a strong brunch is the best
                  way to start a cheeky weekend or get over a hangover!
